GitHub Project - RESTURAUNT PICKER
This project will show a random resturaunt picker that will be easy and simple to use.
This will also allow the user to choose between three different categories of food


Kent Tupas has peer review. Great job on the code. It works like it intend to. I like the comments you put explaining what the code does.
